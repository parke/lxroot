In anticipation of binding files, '--' is now required before command.


20210801

Rebuilt Logic :: binds().  It is now simpler and (more?) correct.
Specifically:  I believe Lxroot now ignores (i.e. skips) overbound
binds.  This is beneficial, for example, when using multiple,
partially-overlapping full-overlays.

Added '/usr/local/games:/usr/games' to $PATH.


20210627

Implemented environment passthru via -e or --env.
Added 'e' and 'w' indicators to command prompt.
Omit the newroot-option to remain in the external mount namespace.


20210624

Fix GitHub issue #3, as follows:
If remount readonly fails, retry with different flags until success.
Split Lxroot::env() into two parts.  Second part happens after umount2().
Disabled some poorly-formed (i.e. overly-restrictive) unit tests.


20210621

Replaced abstract "Processor" interfaces with std :: function + lambdas.
Implemented the 'cd' and 'wd' command line options.
Moved logic into class Logic, thereby separating logic from side effects.
A Bind with mode o_none now inherits its mode from its parent.
Converted Opendir iterator to  Logic.scandir() function.


20210617

Shell prompt guestname is now the basename of last overlay.
(Previously, it was the basename of newroot.  Using the last overlay
is more informative.)


20210612

Added read-auto exposure of /var/tmp.


20210608

Added Demo #3 to demo.sh.  Improved readme.md.


20210605

Significant internal refactoring to improve readability and future
maintainability.  CLI interface unchanged.  Minor improvements/fixes
to readauto mode.


20210530

Major overhaul.  CLI interface changed.  Added read-auto mode.
Removed profiles.  Added unit.sh and demo.sh.  Changed license to
GPLv3.


20200908

Major overhaul.  Many parts refactored into a C++ style.  Command line
interface redesigned.  Improvements and changes to profiles.  Added
tracking of cwd and chdir() to cwd inside the namespace if possible.
